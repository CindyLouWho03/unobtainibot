        <h1>Unobtainibot</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Unobtainibot</b> is a Discord bot coded in Python using discord.py. It has a bunch
            of commands and stuff. Yeah. Oh, and it also has a stupidly messy codebase.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of right now, Unobtainibot isn't being ran at all outside of testing, mostly because
            I don't have any way of running it 24/7, so no invite link, sorry :(
        </p>

        <a href="http://github.com/TntMatthew/unobtainibot">GitHub Repo</a> - command reference is
        in the readme, so if you want to run it yourself for whatever reason, that's there
